# Welcome to ReBlock
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the ReBlock app across Windows and macOS (Soon™).

# What is ReBlock?
ReBlock is a CLI-based application that allows you to unblock things like apps.

We want to allow people like students or people who somehow forget their admin passwords to allow them to regain control of their devices.

Tools such as [appUnblocker](https://github.com/yourworstnightmare1/appunblocker) and [packageExpander](https://github.com/yourworstnightmare1/packageexpander) are the base for ReBlock, and there's new stuff coming soon!
