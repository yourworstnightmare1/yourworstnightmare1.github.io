The next-gen webOS and development environment with full linux emulation

---

## What is AnuraOS?

An entirely local browser "OS" and development environment with complete graphical linux emulation, visually based on chromiumOS. See a demo [here](https://anura.pro), fully in your browser.

> [!NOTE]  
> Due to numerous issues with Firefox's implementation of certain web standards, it is not supported on Anura.
> Please use a chromium-based browser or you will have a significantly diminished user experience.
> Safari is also fully compatible, as long as you have MacOS Sonoma, or iPadOS/iOS 17 or later.

Anura uses the features of a progressive-web-app to make its environment work fully offline, providing a virtual filesystem (synced with the linux emulator), a code editor, and a modular and extensible app system. You can even edit Anura's code live while inside of it!

Anura shows as more of a proof-of-concept with what's possible on the modern web rather than an actual product. However, it proves useful in many actual cases and is a useful educational tool.

## What can AnuraOS do?

-   Run linux GUI apps from a terminal

# Development

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Anura will not build on Windows. Please use a Linux VM or WSL

### Easy Install (When in a codespace)

-   Run `bash codespace-basic-setup.sh`

**NOTE**: If you are not in a codespace skip to the regular installation steps.

**NOTE**: This does NOT build RootFS.

### Installation

-   Make sure you have `rustup` and run the command: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
-   You also need to have a C compiler, inotifytools and a decent version of java installed
-   Clone the repository with `git clone --recursive`
-   Then, `make all`

*   NOTE: You can use `make all -B` instead if you want to force a full build.

### Building ROOTFS

-   Make sure you have `Docker` installed and running.
-   Run `make rootfs`
-   Make sure to add yourself to the Docker group using `usermod -a -G docker $USER`
-   (Special Use Case) In the event that you should need to override/manually add the initrd and kernel, remember to keep track of the file names of initrd and vmlinuz in build/images/debian-boot/. Then, copy them to the Anura root directory and rename them to initrd.img and bzimage respectively.(See the extended instructions [here](./documentation/Kernel_Override.md).)

### Running Anura

You can run anura with the command

```sh
make server
```

Or, run authenticated with

```sh
cd server
npm start -- --auth
```

## After Installation

**NOTE**: Anura uses recent web technologies, and is unstable in Gecko. Chromium is **strongly recommended** as it has seen the best results.

-   If you started the server, Anura should be running at `localhost:8000`.

## Documentation

Still being written. (See the current index of documentation [here](./documentation/README.md))

## Security

AnuraOS is created by [Mercury Workshop](https://mercurywork.shop). Linux emulation is based off of the [v86](https://github.com/copy/v86) project
